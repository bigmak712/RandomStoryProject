Each option leads to a different story direction depending on which option was picked. As you progress through the story, you will always be given three possible options that you can pick from. In order to progress further along, you can click the \"Hint\" button to receive a hint(duh) on what you should do next. Or you can just pick a different option and do whatever. Up to you. Have fun!!!"
